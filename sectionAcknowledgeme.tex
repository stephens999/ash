Statistical analyses were conducted in the {\sf R} programming language \cite{Rcore:2012}, Figures produced using the {\tt ggplot2} package \cite{ggplot2}, and text
prepared using \LaTeX. Development of the methods in this paper was greatly enhanced by the use of the {\tt knitr} package \cite{xie2013dynamic}  within the RStudio GUI, and 
git and github. The {\tt ashr} R package is available from \url{http://github.com/stephens999/ashr} and includes contributions
