This repository is no longer in active use, but serves as an archive. 
It was the original repository I set up when I started working on my ``adaptive shrinkage" work. 

Because the repo was getting rather out of hand I moved the package to its own repo. So:
the ashr R package is now [here](https://github.com/stephens999/ashr)

Then I wanted to refactor my repo in light of lessons I learned about how to better organize my workflow
and make things more reproducible. The refactored repo, including the paper, figures, and related documents, is now [here](https://github.com/stephenslab/ash)
