\label{fig:lfsr_pval} Figure illustrating affects of prior assumptions on re-ordering of significance. Left panel shows results under our ``default prior" which assumes that effects $\beta_j$ are identically distributed, independent of $s_j$. Right panel shows results under the ``$p$-value prior", which assumes that $z$ scores $\beta_j/s_j$ are identically distributed, independent of $s_j$.
