\label{fig:lfsr-nn} Comparison of true and estimated $\lfsr$ when data are simulated with no point mass at zero ($\pi_0=0$), and also analyzed by \ashr with no point mass on 0 (and mixture of normal components for $g$). Black line is $y=x$ and red line is $y=2x$. The results illustrate how estimates of $\lfsr$ can be more accurate in this case. That is, assuming there is no point mass can be beneficial if that is indeed true.
